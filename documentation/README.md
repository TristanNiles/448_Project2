# 448-Project1
This is a Battleship project for EECS 448.
It is written primarily in JavaScript.
To play, visit the [GitHub Pages deployment](https://gsburmaster.github.io/448-Project1/).
[The auto-generated docs](docs/index.html) were made with [documentation.js](https://documentation.js.org).
We estimated 50 total hours (~10 hours per person) to complete the project. We agreed this seemed reasonable based on the scope of the project and the amount of time we had to complete the project.
